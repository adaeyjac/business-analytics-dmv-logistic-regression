# business-analytics-dmv-logistic-regression
This project performs logistic regression analysis on DMV written test scores. Key tasks include generating a confusion matrix, calculating accuracy, precision, sensitivity, exploring cutoffs, and plotting the ROC curve. 

## Project Overview
- Dataset: DMV written test scores for two tests (DMV_Test_1 and DMV_Test_2) and results (0 = failed, 1 = passed).
- Tasks performed:
  - Scatter plots of test scores
  - Logistic regression model
  - Cost and gradient computation
  - Gradient descent optimization
  - Confusion matrix and evaluation metrics for cutoffs 0.5 and 0.2
  - ROC curve with AUC calculation

## Files

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Logistic regression modeling
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, ROC/AUC)
